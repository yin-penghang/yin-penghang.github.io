I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at the State University of New York at Albany. My research spans analytical and computational methods for signal and image processing, as well as machine learning. 

Currently, I am focused on advancing efficient inference and fine-tuning techniques for modern AI models, including large language models. My research is partially supported by [National Science Foundation](https://www.nsf.gov/) and [SUNY-IBM AI Research Alliance](https://www.suny.edu/ai-research-alliance/).
