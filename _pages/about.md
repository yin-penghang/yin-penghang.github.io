I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Mathematics and Statistics](https://www.albany.edu/math) at the [State University of New York at Albany](https://www.albany.edu/) and a member of the machine learning group of math department. I have broad interests in analytical and computational methods for problems in applied mathematics, especially in signal and image processing, numerical optimization, and machine learning.
